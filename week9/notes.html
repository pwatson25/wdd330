        <h2>Ch 9: The Window Object</h2>
        <h4>
            The Browser Object Model
        </h4>
        <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
            information about the broswer and computer screen.</p>
        <p>If you don't know the name of the global object, you can also refer to it using the keybord <span>This</span>
            in the global scope.</p>
        <h4>Browser Information</h4>
        <p>The <span>window</span> object has a number of properties and methods that provide information aboutthe
            user's browser. </p>
        <h4>Controlling Windows</h4>
        <p>A new window can be opened using the <span>window.open()</span> method.</p>
        <p>These methods are super interesting and you could use it to really bother people with pop-ups. I wonder what
            the full extent of the window method is? Can you prevent a window from being closed? Can you make another
            one open everytime they close it?</p>
        <h4>The Document Object</h4>
        <p>Each <span>window</span> object contains a <span>document</span> object. This object has properties and
            methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</p>
        <h4>The Path and Domain of Cookies</h4>
        <p>By default, cookies can only be read by pages inside the same director and domain as the file was set. This
            id for security reasons so that access to the cookie is limited.</p>
        <h4>Secure Cookies</h4>
        <p>Addint the string <span>; secure</span> to the end of a cookie will ensure it's only transmitted over secure
            HTTPS network.</p>
        <h4>Deleting Cookings</h4>
        <p>To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time in the past.</p>
        <h4>Timing Functions</h4>
        <h5><span>setTimeout()</span></h5>
        <p>Can you use <span>setTimeout()</span> and <span>window.open()</span> together?</p>
        <h2>Ch 14: HTML5 APIs</h2>
        <h4>HTML5 Web Storage</h4>
        <p>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the clients computer that is similar to using cooking but
            has few restrictions, more storage capactity, and is generally easier to use.</p>
        <p>Storage Capactiy limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies (There is no actual limitin the
            specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.)</p>
        <h4>Geolocation</h4>
        <p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to
            find the userâ€™s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving.
        </p>
        <p>PEERLY EDUCATIONAL!! It says "Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the
            user first. Soooo... this means you can use it against someone???</p>
        <h4>Web Workers</h4>
        <p>Web workers allow process to be run in the background, adding support concurrency in JavaScript.</p>
        <h4>Service Workers</h4>
        <p>The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able
            to intercept network requests.</p>
        <h4>Notifications</h4>
        <p>The Nortification API allows you to show messages using the system's nortifications. An advantage of using
            the system notification is that they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the
            current tab.</p>
