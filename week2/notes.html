        <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This week was mostly focused on getting the portfolio started. I noticed right off the bat that the example
            didn't actually show what the text said it was showing. The textbook made no sense and didn't seem to
            corespond at all. However, as classes are just starting, I was rushed and working on many other things that
            needed to get done. So when I finally sat down to do this assignment, what struck me was that we should use
            principles we learned in WDD 230. So this is how I did it...</p>
        <p>I understood that the idea was to select an ol, read a list of links from an array and then build out an li
            element with an a element containing a label and url. The idea was that each week you would add to your
            array with new links and labels and it would autamatically add it to our ol list. So I decided to make mine
            using a JSON file. I had done stuff like this before. Now, I don't know why my main index needs to drill
            into an individual weekly index. But I guess some weeks will have excersises and group assignments where as
            others wont. So it won't be the same each week. Anyways, I made that the main index is also an array that
            gets autopopulated, cause why not? ðŸ˜…</p>
