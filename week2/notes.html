        <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This week I fixed my js to pull the page title and then determine which JSON object to use from that. I was
            really happy that it was a simple one line ðŸ˜…. A quick question before I get into the notes... Can I use
            PHP?</p>
        <h3>Ch2: Programming Basics</h3>
        <p>Automatic Semicolon Insetion (insert bad joke...) An interesting idea but best to just use semicolons since
            the ASI often causes problems.</p>
        <p>Benefits between var and const? Const doesn't allow you to reasign a value to it (think about asimple
            calculator, you could just reasign the value once the math is done) but this is considered bad practice.
            Prefarable to use multiple const. Const will also keep you from overwriting any built-in methods by
            assignment, which is generally frowned upon, whereas using var doesn't.</p>
        <p>Global scope, keep it to a minumum... Interesting. I really can't imagine it being that common of an issue.
            Better to use local scope (let, const)</p>
        <p>May want to take note of how to use spcial characters</p>
        <p>Familiar with math. See team activity</p>
        <p>Oh hey! PHP is also weakly typed.</p>
        <p>VERY familiar with logical operators</p>
        <p>I'd like to see an example of bitwise operators.</p>
        <h3>Ch3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h3>
        <p>I'm very familiar with arrays, logic, and loops. I am allllll about my loops inside of loops, with logical
            statements helping determine exactly what to get. I have some complex array's that I am rather proud of that
            required some tough loops. Check it out here: <a href="https://pwatson25.github.io/lesson11/index.html">WDD

        </p>
        <p>I've never fully seen the benefit to pop, push,shift, and unshift.
