    <main>
        <p>Right now, I have it set up that I would need a new js file each week to select the correct weeks worth of
            arrays and populate off of that. This seems inefficiant to me... Though not necisarrily bad since page speed
            will be low. However, my question for the week would be how to set it up so it registers which week the
            index is in and grabs the correct one. Should be possible. Something as easy as page title should work. So
            each individual index (meaning week 1 index, week 2 index etc.) would grab the page title and determine
            which part of the jsObject to use.</p>
