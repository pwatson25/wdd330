        <h2>
            Chapter 8: CSS3 Transforms and Transitions
        </h2>
        <h4>Transforms</h4>
        <p>The CSS3 <span>transform</span> property lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the
            page.</p>
        <h4>Translation</h4>
        <p>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the
            behaviour of <span>posistion: relative;</span> when declaring <span>top</span> and <span>left</span>, moving
            elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes.</p>
        <p>A translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.</p>
        <h4>Scaling</h4>
        <p>The <span>scale(x,y)</span> function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically.
        </p>
        <p>As with <span>translate</span>, you can also use the <span>scaleX(x)</span> or <span>scaleY(y)</span>
            functions. These functions will scale only the horizontal dimensions or only the vertical dimensions
            respectively.</p>
        <h4>Rotation</h4>
        <p>The <span>rotate()</span> function rotates an element around the point of orgin by a specified angle value.
        </p>
        <h4>Changing the Origin of the Transform</h4>
        <p>The orgin of transform can be controled by using the <span>transform-origin</span> property.</p>
        <p>It has the same syntax as the <span>background-position</span></p>
        <h4>Transitions</h4>
        <p>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.
        </p>
        <p>The <span>transition-property</span> property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be
            transitioned, with <span>all</span> for all properties being the default.</p>
        <h4>The <span>transition-duration</span> Property</h4>
        <p>The <span>transition-duration</span> property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it
            takes to go from the defualt state to the transitioned state.</p>
        <h4>The <span>transition-timing-function</span> Property</h4>
        <p>The <span>transition-timing-function</span> lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular
            detail.</p>
        <p>You can describe your timing function more precisely by defining your own <span>cubic-bezier</span>
            function.</p>
        <h4>The <span>transition-delay</span> Property</h4>
        <p>The <span>transition-delay</span> property make it possible to add a delay before the transition begins.</p>
        <h5>Negative Delays</h5>
        <p>A negative time delay that's less than the duration of the entire transition will cause it to start
            immediately, but it will start partway through the animation.</p>
        <h4>
            Animations
        </h4>
        <p>CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.</p>
        <h2>Chapter 12:Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
        <h4>Creating a <span>canvas</span> Element</h4>
        <h5>Setting width and height</h5>
        <p>The <span>canvas</span> element takes both a <span>width</span> and <span>height</span> attribute, which must
            also be set.</p>
        <p>Setting the <span>width</span> and <span>height</span> attributes determine how large the canva's coordinate
            system is. If you don't specify <span>width</span> and <span>height</span>, the <span>canvas</span> element
            will defualt to a width of 300 and a height of 150. If you set the wedth and height for a canvas only in
            CSS, the <span>canvas</span> element will be 300 by 150, and the CSS properties will simply determine how
            large the box is that displays the image.</p>
        <h4>
            Drawing Other Shapes by Creating Paths
        </h4>
        <p>Canvas is not limited to drawing rectangles. Unlike rectangles and squares, however, there's no built-in
            method for drawing circles or other shapes. To draw more interesting shapes, you must first lay out the path
            of the shape.</p>
        <p>Paths create a blueprint for your lines, arcs, and shapes, but paths are invisible until you give them a
            stroke.</p>
        <h4>Saving Cavas Drawings</h4>
        <p>If you create an image programmatically using the Canvas API, but decide you'd like to have a local copy of
            the drawing, you can use the API's <span>toDataURL</span> method to save our drawing. <span>toDataURL</span>
            creates a URL with the image in it, (either a png or jpg, whichever is specified).</p>
        <h4>Manipulating Images</h4>
        <p>Once an image is drawn on the <span>canvas</span>, you can use the <span>getImageData</span> method from the
            Canvas API to manipulate the pixels of that image. </p>
        <h4>Drawing in SVG</h4>
        <p>I am very familiar with SVG's. What are the benefits of using svg over canvas or vise versa?</p>
        <h4>Canvas versus SVG</h4>
        <p>Canvas allows for pixel manipulation. One downside of canvas is that it operates in what’s known as immediate
            mode. This means that if you ever want to add more to the canvas, you’re unable to simply add to what’s
            already there. Every time you finish drawing a shape, the canvas no longer has access to that shape, because
            it won’t persist as an object that you can modify. So if you want to add to what you’ve already drawn on the
            canvas, you must redraw the new shape from scratch.</p>
        <p>what you draw to SVG is accessible via the DOM, because its mode is retained mode, meaning that the structure
            of the image is preserved in the XML document that describes it. SVG also has, at this time, a more complete
            set of tools to help you work with it, such as the Raphaël library and Inkscape. However, since SVG is a
            file format—rather than a set of methods that allows you to dynamically draw on a surface—you can’t
            manipulate SVG images the way you can manipulate pixels on canvas.</p>

        <h5>Though: Just use photoshop to draw your svg's. Then you can edit them and resave them easily.</h5>
