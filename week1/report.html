        <p>1. What did I do since the last meeting?</p>
        <p>Since our last meeting that hasn't ever happend... I created this! Meaning I created a JSON file and JS to
            build out links and labels to autopopulate into my html. Is this anymore effective than just adding to a nav
            menu??? Probably not... An array is better if we had a LOT of links to add...</p>
        <p>2. What am I going to do next?</p>
        <p>Well I realized that when you click on notes, report, or exercises... you would have to click the back button
            to navigate back to the index. So I will add a basic button to all pages that will take them to the index. I
            bet I could just make the array do that... That would actually save time. I also will try and see if I can
            specifically make the js determine which jsObject to pull from based off of page name.</p>
        <p>3. What are my blocker?</p>
        <p>Taking notes! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I hate taking notes. I'd rather just do the assignment and move on. Taking notes means
            explaining my thought process. My thought process is complicated and very confusing. Also, I don't actually
            know how to select the page title. Would it be easier to use a counter function? There will be many things
            to look at and decide. Can't quite say what will end up being the blocker, yet.</p>
