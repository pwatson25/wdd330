        <h4>
            A Searching Example
        </h4>
        <p>
            Please see the search example<a href="search.html">here</a>. I noticed that the event property is
            deprecated. I added a seperate event listener to fix it.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Input Fields
        </h4>
        <p>I am familiar with input fields. Interested in how the checkboxes can create an array. Could be useful with
            backend development.</p>
        <h2>
            Chapter 12
        </h2>
        <p>I've made a dice game.</p>
        <h4>Es6 Class Declarations</h4>
        <p>I've only done it with functions before. Cool to see it differently.</p>
        <p>Not may notes to really take on here...</p>
        <h4>
            The Prototype Object
        </h4>
        <p>
            All functions have a prototype property that returns an object, with is initially empty.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Overwriting Prototype Properties
        </h4>
        <p>
            An instance object can overwrite any properties or methods inherited from it's prototype by simply assigning
            a new value to it.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Public and Private Methods
        </h4>
        <p>
            By default, an object's method's are public in JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Frameworks
        </h4>
        <p>
            A framework is a library of JavaScript code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve
            common tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            jQuery is the most popular of all the JavaScript frameworks.
        </p>
        <h4>
            When to Use a Library
        </h4>
        <p>
            It seems that it can provide only the parts of methods you need on a module-by module basis. But it seems it
            can also be a negative to use them.
        </p>
        <h4>
            MVC Frameworks
        </h4>
        <p>
            Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that's been used for a long time in server-side languages.
        </p>
        <h4>
            MV* Frameworks
        </h4>
        <p>
            One of the main features of MVC frameworks is data binding, which is the process of linking the model and
            view together. As a result, a large amount of boilerplate controller code is not needed as the framework
            takes care of it all in the background for you.
