            Chapter 11: Further Functions
        </h2>
        <h4>
            Call and Apply Methods
        </h4>
        <p>The <span>call()</span> method can be used to set the value of <span>this</span> inside a function to an
            object that is provided as the first argument.</p>
        <p>If the function that's called requires any parameters, these need to be provided as arguments after the first
            argument, which is always the valie of <span>this</span></span></p>
        <p>If a function doesn't refer to an object as <span>this</span> in it's body, it can still be called using the
            <span>call()</span> method, but you need provide <span>null</span> as it's first argument.
        </p>
        <p>The <span>apply()</span> method works in the same way, except the arguments of the function are provided as
            an array, even if there is only on argument</p>
        <h4>
            Temporary Variables
        </h4>
        <p>There is no way to remove a variable from a scope once it's been declared. Placeing any code that uses the
            temporary variable inside an IIFE will ensure it's only available while the IIFE is invoked, this it will
            disappear.</p>
        <h4>
            Safe Use of Strict Mode
        </h4>
        <p>
            The recommended way to use strict mode is to place all your code inside an IIFE
        </p>
        <h4>
            Event-driven Asynchronous Programming
        </h4>
        <p>
            Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming. By using callbacks, we ensure
            that waiting for these tasks to complete doesn't hold up the execution of other parts of the program. Once
            the task has been completed, the callback will be invoked before returning to the rest of the program.
        </p>
        <h4>Promises</h4>
        <p>A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. Promises don't do anything that can't
            already be achieved using callbacks.</p>
        <h4>Closures/Function Scope</h4>
        <p>A closure is a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function, but is then
            kept alive and used in another part of the program.</p>
        <p>A closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function, maintaining access to any
            variables declared inside the enclosing function.</p>
        <p>A closure doesn't just have access to the value of a variable, it can also change the value of the variable
            long after the function in which it was originally declared has been invoked.</p>
        <h4>
            Generators
        </h4>
        <p>These are special functions used to produce iterators that maintain the state of a value.</p>
        <p>To define a generator function, an asterisk (<span>*</span>) is placed after the function declaration.</p>
        <h2>Chapter 13: Ajax</h2>
        <h4>Ajax</h4>
        <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically
            updates web pages without reloading.</p>
        <h4>
            Fetch API
        </h4>
        <p>What are the limitation of <span>fetch()</span>? I've used this before for many different API's. But am
            wondering if I can "scrap" information from anywhere with it.</p>
        <h4>File Responses</h4>
        <p>The <span>blob()</span> method is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet.</p>
        <h4>JSON Responses</h4>
        <p>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX reponses. The <span>json()</span> method is used to deal
            with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</p>
        <h4>Headers Interface</h4>
        <p>HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response.</p>
        <p>
            The Fetch API introduced a <span>Headers</span> interface, which can be used to create a Headers object,
            which can then be added as a property of Request and Response objects.
        </p>
        <h4>Sending Information</h4>
        <p>What are the limitations here??? This is incredible. And would be much simplier for me to understand for the
            ToDo list. JSON array's are awesome. But would it get overcomplicated when you mark things as done?</p>
        <h4><span>FormData</span></h4>
        <p>The Fetch API includes the <span>FormData</span> interface, which makes it muc heasier to submit information
            in forms using Ajax.</p>
        <p>The <span>FormData</span> interface really comes into its own when a form contains files to upload.</p>
