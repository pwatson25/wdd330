        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        <h4>Accessing Properties</h4>
        <p>
            Dot notation is more common, but bracket notation has a few advatages: it's the only way to access
            nonstandard property and method names that don't follow the variable naming rules. It also lets you evaluate
            an expression and use it as the property key.
        </p>
        <h4>Calling Methods</h4>
        <p>Calling a method is the same as invoking a function, so parentheses need to be placed after the method name
        </p>
        <h4>Adding/Changing Properties</h4>
        <p>I still don't understand the advantage of these. I'd like to see a real example when this would be useful.
        </p>
        <h4>Math</h4>
        <p>I am familiar with math functions</p>
        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        <h4>What is the DOM?</h4>
        <p>The DOM treates everything on a web page as a node.</p>
        <h4>An Example Web Page</h4>
